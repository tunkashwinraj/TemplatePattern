# Student GPA Calculator with Template Pattern

## Overview
This project implements a Student GPA Calculator using the Template Pattern design pattern. The Template Pattern defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to implement specific steps while maintaining the overall algorithm structure. This project demonstrates how the GPA calculation process can be generalized and customized using different data sources and grading strategies.

## Features
- **Template Pattern**: The main algorithm for GPA calculation is predefined, and subclasses define specific steps like reading data and calculating grades.
- **Customizable Grading Strategies**: Different grading strategies can be used to calculate the GPA based on user preferences or data source.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: The program can fetch student data either from a file or from a database, providing flexibility for different environments.

## Architecture
- **Abstract Class (GPAAlgorithm)**: Defines the structure of the algorithm with abstract methods for reading data and calculating grades.
- **Concrete Classes**: Subclasses implement the abstract methods, allowing for different data sources and GPA calculation strategies.
- **Client Code**: Executes the template with different configurations, based on user input or program settings.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (e.g., for file/database connections).

4. Run the `Main.java` or equivalent class to execute the GPA calculator.

5. Follow the prompts to choose the data source (file/database) and grading strategy.

## Example
Here is a simplified example of how the template pattern is implemented:

```java
public abstract class GPAAlgorithm {
    public final void calculateGPA() {
        List<Student> students = readStudentData();
        for (Student student : students) {
            double gpa = calculateGrade(student);
            System.out.println("Student: " + student.getName() + " GPA: " + gpa);
        }
    }

    protected abstract List<Student> readStudentData(); // To read data from a file or database
    protected abstract double calculateGrade(Student student); // Grading strategy
}
```

## Grading Strategies
- **Percentage-based**: GPA calculated based on percentage score.
- **CGPA**: Cumulative GPA calculation strategy.
